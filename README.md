Our project is a carbon footprint calculator aimed to help college students reduce their negative impact on the environment. Our calculator is adapted from the EPA and uses their data.


# Completed User stories in Iteration 1
- User can get recommendations on where to reduce carbon emissions based on their calculator results
- User can take pledges on different ways to reduce their carbon footprint
- User can track their daily carbon emissions
- User can more accurately find out their flight emissions with the carbon footprint calculator
- User can find out their car emissions with the carbon footprint calculator
- Flight emissions basic calculation based on the flight type (short-haul vs. long-haul)

# User stories to be completed in next iteration
- User can find out more information about carbon footprint (informational)
- User can test their knowledge about carbon footprint related things
- User will have a more user-friendly experience
- (Possibly) User can see a pie graph of their carbon emissions - visualizations rather than reading numbers
- User can enter this ZIP code to get more exact emission factors (rather than assuming the 63112 zip code)
- User can find out carbon emissions from public transportation with the carbon footprint calculator

# Anything that is implemented but doesn't work
- We still need to combine the Tracker app with the rest of the app (option 3)

# Commands needed to run program
- First clone repo to your personal laptop 
- Finally run the following

  bash cfCalculatorAndTracker.sh
