Our project is a carbon footprint calculator aimed to help college students reduce their negative impact on the environment. Our calculator is adapted from the EPA and uses their data.


# Completed User stories in Iteration 1
- House energy emissions part of calculator
- Flight emissions basic calculation based on the flight type (short-haul vs. long-haul)

# User stories to be completed in next iteration
-Add section in the calculator for waste and cars
-Calculator should have a capability to identify where an individual can reduce their carbon footprint
- Add tests for everything

# Anything that is implemented but doesn't work
- House energy emissions doesn't account for invalid input

# Commands needed to run program
- First clone repo to your personal laptop or at least save the java file (CarbonFootPrintCalculator.java) locally
- Second, navigate to the CarbonFootPrintCalculator.java file on your local machine
- Finally run the following

  javac CarbonFootPrintCalculator.java
  java CarbonFootPrintCalculator.java
