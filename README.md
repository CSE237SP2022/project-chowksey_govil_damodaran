Our project is a carbon footprint calculator aimed to help college students reduce their negative impact on the environment. Our calculator is adapted from the EPA and uses their data.


# Completed User stories in Iteration 3
- User can test their knowledge about carbon footprint related things with a beginner quiz or an advanced quiz - and learn from these quizzes too
- User can enter this ZIP code to get more exact emission factors (rather than assuming the 63112 zip code)
- User can find out carbon emissions from public transportation with the carbon footprint calculator
- User can use tracker to track cummulative usage
- User can loop through different parts of the application without having to restart it over and over again
- User can see percentage breakdown of carbon footprint calculator results

# User stories to be completed in next iteration

- User can see a pie graph of their carbon emissions - visualizations rather than reading numbers
- User can compare their carbon footprint and tracker information to friends (social media aspect)
- User can access information modules to learn more about carbon footprint, global warming, etc.
- User can skip parts of the carbon footprint calculator if it isn't applicable to them

# Anything that is implemented but doesn't work
- We are trying to implement a data visualization API to display a pie chart graph of the emissions as a way for users. However, we are running into issues
  using the API we want and decided to hold off on it.

# Commands needed to run program
- First clone repo to your personal laptop 
- Finally run the following

  bash cfCalculatorAndTracker.sh
